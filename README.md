# StackBuilders

# iOS Architecture Design

As an iOS Engineer I follow Uncle Bobâ€™s Clean Architecture and SOLID Principles, and apply them to iOS development using Swift and Objective-C. This leads to easily extensible and testable code.

# External pods

'''
target 'StackBuilderDemo' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for StackBuilderDemo

	pod 'Alamofire'
    pod 'AlamofireObjectMapper'

end
